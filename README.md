# PythonProject
Learning Python!
Hello! It's been 7 years since I last wrote or even updated this Repository!

Within GitHub, to Clone I simply did:
git clone https://github.com/Christian0257/PythonProject

Easy! No need to add Credientials either which is half-good, half-bad.

Let's Own Python Christian! And let's make it so that if anyone asks for some task in Python, I will never feel threatened again!
