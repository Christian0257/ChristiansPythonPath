Learning Python!
Hello! It's been 7 years since I last wrote or even updated this Repository!

Within GitHub, to Clone I simply did:
git clone https://github.com/Christian0257/PythonProject

Easy! No need to add Credientials either which is half-good, half-bad.

Let's Own Python Christian! And let's make it so that if anyone asks for some task in Python, I will never feel threatened again!

Ah! And don't forget to use the fine grained personal access token when pushing or otherwise! Use it in place for the password since GitHub updated Authentication back in 2021! Have Fun!
